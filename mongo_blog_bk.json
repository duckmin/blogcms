Contrary to popular belief, the \"great wall\" isn't a single wall. There are many, many wall sections built over many hundreds of years, the earliest being simple walls built out of mud in the 7th century BC.\n\nThe impressive large stone walls that most people are familiar with in pictures and which are most often visited by tourists were built during the Ming dynasty and were lightly manned by sentries to give early warning of invasions. They were not built as a primary fighting structure, but designed to slow down an invasion force and allow time for defending forces to rally to repel invaders.\n" } ] }
